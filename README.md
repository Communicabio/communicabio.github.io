# Communicabio
Communicabio is our solution for [Metachallenge](https://practicingfutures.org/meta). First intended to be Vk Mini App. Unfortuently we did not pass review.

Communicabio is chatbot for practicing negotiation skill. Dialogs are available in Russian and English, however, UI is only in Russian.
